Reference: NURSERY data with 12960 observations

 

a)      Classify the data using 1) C4.5 and 2) CART decision tree algorithms.

b)      In each case, divide the data randomly in 70:30 ratios as the training and test sets.

c)      Learn the classifiers using the training data set.

d)     Verify the classifier’s performance on the test set. Use 10-fold cross validation.

e)      Show the performance measure in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall and Confusion matrix.

f)       Compare the two classifiers by drawing ROC curve
